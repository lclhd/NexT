## 1.Use commas to separate items in a series of three or more things.

Remember that an "item" may refer to a noun, verb, or adjective phrase.

Note: Usage of comma to separate the second-to-last item is optional.

Example: I bought ham, cheese, and bread.

## 2.Use a comma to separate independent clauses (complete thoughts) when they are joined by the following conjunctions:

F(for)A(and)N(nor)B(but)O(or)Y(yet)S(so), that is FANBOYS

Note:The comma comes BEFOREthe conjunction

Example: The weather was cold, yet we had a great time.

## 3.Use a comma to separate a dependent clause (incomplete thought) from an independent clause(complete thought).

Example: If you finish your reports by Thursday, I'll give you Friday off.

## 4.Use a comma to separate any word or phrase from the rest of the sentence that isn't essential to the sentence's meaning.

Example: Jane, my girlfriend, is coming to the party tonight.

## 5.Use a comma to separate a quotation from the rest of a sentence.

In American English, commas always go before closing quotation marks.

Example: "When you leave the room," my mother yelled, "turned off the lights!"

Note: If a quotation before an attributive tag ends in a qustion mark or exclamation poing, don't use a comma.

Example: "Where are you?" he asked.

## 6.Use a comma to separate an introductory element from the rest of a sentence.

Example: Hey, how are you today?

Example: Unfortunately, I didn't finish my work on time.

## 7.Use a comma to separate the name of a city from a country or state.

Example: I lived in Madrid, Spain from nearly a decade.

## 8.Use a comma to separate the day of the week, the day of the month, and the year.

Example: Please join us on Saturday, April 4, 2020, for the wedding of Sawyer and Jennifer.
