# Clean Verbatim

### The transcribed text does not include:

- **Speech errors**

- **False starts** (unless they add information)

- **Studders**

- **Repetitions**. Note: Keep repetitions of words that express emphasis: No, no, no. I am very, very happy.

- **Filler words**: Words often excessively used by the speaker but when you take them out, you're left with perfectly understandable sentences. uh, um, you know, like, I mean, so, kind of, well, sort of ... Be mindful of the context. Some of these filler words do not always function as filler words.

- Expressions should be kept regardless of verbatim type: Oh my God, Oh dear, Oh my, Oh boy, Oh, et cetera.

- **Slang word** must be written as "got you" instead of "gotcha", "going to" instead of "gonna", "want to" instead of "wanna", "because" instead of "'cause" et cetera.

- "Yeah", "yep", "yap", "yup", "mm-hmm" must be written as "yes"; "alright" must be written as "all right".

- Never spell "Ok" or "OK". It must always be spelled as "Okay".

- Avoid starting phrases with conjuctions in clean verbatim. If you really need to add the conjuntion, just expand the sentence. For example: "I went outside but forget to bring my umbrella."

### Note For CV: Omit all the "yeah", "yes" reactions to retain a fluent text unless they are answers to given questions.

### DO NOT remove filler words if they change the meaning of the phrase.
